# Product Guidelines: HomeLab Connect

## Brand Voice & Tone
- **Primary Tone:** Professional, Trustworthy, and Empathetic.
- **Voice:**
    - **Reliable:** Language should be precise and accurate, instilling confidence in the medical nature of the service.
    - **Accessible:** Avoid overly complex medical jargon where possible. Explain terms clearly to empower users.
    - **Supportive:** Use warm and reassuring language, especially during the booking and results delivery phases, to ease patient anxiety.
- **Messaging:** Focus on "Health at your doorstep," "Trusted Diagnostics," and "Simplified Care."

## Visual Identity
- **Color Palette:**
    - **Primary:** Clean Blues and Teals (representing health, trust, and cleanliness).
    - **Secondary:** Soft Greens (growth, wellness) and Warm Greys (neutrality, balance).
    - **Accent:** Alert colors (Red/Orange) used sparingly for urgent notifications or critical values.
- **Typography:**
    - **Headings:** Clean, modern Sans-Serif (e.g., Inter, Roboto, or similar) for readability and authority.
    - **Body:** Highly legible Sans-Serif optimized for digital screens and varying text sizes.
- **Imagery:**
    - Use high-quality, authentic photography showing diverse people in comfortable home settings or professional medical contexts.
    - Avoid generic stock photos; prefer warm, human-centric imagery.
    - Use clean, simple iconography for medical categories (e.g., heart, lungs, blood drop).

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Simplicity First:** The booking process must be intuitive. Reduce friction in the "Search -> Select -> Book" flow.
- **Transparency:** Clearly display costs, turnaround times, and lab ratings. No hidden fees.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the platform is usable by elderly users and those with visual impairments (high contrast, scalable text, clear buttons).
- **Mobile-First Design:** Optimize all flows for mobile devices, as many users will book via phone.
- **Reassurance:** Provide clear status updates at every step (e.g., "Collector is on the way," "Sample reached lab") to build trust.

## Code & Design Standards
- **Component Library:** Utilize a consistent UI kit (like Shadcn UI as identified in `package.json`) to maintain visual consistency.
- **Responsive Layouts:** All pages must fully adapt to Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile viewports.
- **Performance:** Prioritize fast load times, especially for the mobile web experience.
